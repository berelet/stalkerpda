# PDA ZONE - Technical Specifications

## Overview

Spec-driven development approach for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. themed airsoft/LARP game platform.

## Specification Structure

```
specs/
├── game-mechanics/     # Game rules and mechanics
├── database/           # Database schema and models
├── api/                # API endpoints and contracts
└── frontend/           # UI/UX specifications
```

## Development Flow

1. **Write Spec** - Define requirements, data structures, API contracts
2. **Review Spec** - Validate completeness and consistency
3. **Implement** - Code according to spec
4. **Test** - Verify implementation matches spec
