1\. Quest Template vs Instance Model:  
   \- Quest shall be for single use in MVP. Collaborations quest will be added in next iteration.

2\. Artifact Quest Failure Logic:  
   \- If someone pick up an artifact, quests fail automatically.

3\. Reputation Integration:  
   \-  reputation and discounts are not in the scope of the quest system.

4\. Delivery Quest Validation:  
   \- It can be enabled everywhere. But on click it should validate if all conditions are passed sucessfully

5\. Protection Quest:  
   I think we should make it simple with manual control:

\- player A pick up the quest "protect player B" from the trader.і

\- if player B is dead, quest marked as failed.

\- Game master manual finish quest as "successfully finished"

6\. Quest Expiration:  
   \- There is no expiration in the MVP. GM will close all quests manually by the end of the game.

7\. Frontend Quest Page:

- I’m not sure. Check if frontend meets specs about quests.
